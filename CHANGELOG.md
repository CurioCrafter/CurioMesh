# Changelog

## 0.5.1 - 2026-10-27

- Wider Blender support: the legacy add-on now installs and passes the test
  suites on Blender 3.6 LTS and newer; the extension package needs 4.2 LTS or
  newer. Verified on 3.6, 4.2, 4.5, 5.0, 5.1 and 5.2. Blender 3.0 and older
  are not supported.
- Release assets are named by Blender range:
  `curiomesh-<ver>-blender-3.6-plus-addon.zip` and
  `curiomesh-<ver>-blender-4.2-plus-extension.zip`.
- Tests no longer assume Python 3.11 (`tomllib`) or a specific EEVEE engine id.
- Tested on 13 real meshes (244 to 1.9M faces: scans, game assets, FBX/OBJ/GLB).
- Atlas-Q Auto now succeeds on real game assets that it used to reject
  (multi-shell, slightly dirty meshes): a few bad quads (3% on Balanced) and
  tiny loose shells no longer fail the gates, and a PairClosure result with
  only soft issues (high aspect, merged shells) is returned with a warning.
- Failures now say why: the message names the closest candidate and its reasons.
- Dirty or multi-shell meshes under Preserve topology, and sources over 200,000
  faces, go PairClosure-first. QuadriFlow is skipped on multi-shell meshes with
  open boundaries, where it could hang for minutes.
- UVs on sources over 300,000 faces are projected with a BVH instead of the
  Data Transfer modifier, which could stall for tens of minutes.
- Analyze uses the fast sampled path above 75,000 faces.
- Heatmap and HUD skip stats on meshes over 300,000 faces instead of slowing
  every redraw; the HUD hint now flags results with many poles.
- Live preview is limited to sources up to 8,000 faces so Blender stays responsive.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-10-27

- Quick Start panel with a big Remesh button, quality buttons and HUD /
  Heatmap / Live toggles; advanced settings moved to collapsed sub-panels.
- Viewport HUD dashboard: quad ratio bar, faces vs target, triangles, poles,
  engine, time and a next-step hint.
- Non-destructive triangle / n-gon / pole heatmap drawn with the GPU module.
- Live preview re-runs PairClosure into a preview object on setting or source
  changes (sources up to 20,000 faces).
- Batch remesh of all selected meshes with progress, cancel and a JSON report.
- TRIAD-Q engine vectorized with NumPy and per-mesh caching: about 100x faster
  quad-dominant and 29x faster all-quad on a 7k-triangle sphere.
- Maximum-cardinality triangle pairing (Edmonds' blossom) on top of the
  score-greedy start; `rescued_pairs` reports the augmentations.
- 4-RoSy cross field with frame transport, pinned to feature edges, drives
  pair alignment.
- README screenshots captured by `scripts/capture_readme_screenshots.py`.

## 0.4.0 hardening

- Normalize vertex-only bow-ties after QEM by deterministically duplicating
  disconnected incident fans without moving geometry or changing face-corner
  attributes; true edge-non-manifolds remain rejected.
- Make shrinkwrap projection transactional. Failed or gate-breaking projection
  restores the validated candidate and records the rollback reason.
- Add adversarial topology, standalone engine, and Blender projection rollback
  regressions grounded in multi-shell photogrammetry parts.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-07-16

- Added Atlas-Q scan analysis and solver portfolio.
- Added target-scale native QEM proxies and deterministic candidate ensembles.
- Added exact conforming PairClosure with UV-seam/material propagation.
- Added area/spatial/component-stratified symmetric RMS, p95, and maximum source
  error with preset-specific hard gates.
- Added vertex-fan manifold, true boundary-cycle, component, duplicate-face,
  winding, concave/crossed-quad, Jacobian, aspect, and target-count validation.
- Added exact-source versus exact-proxy topology proof status in output and UI.
- Moved area, diagonal, aspect, Jacobian, and fidelity gates into world space so
  non-uniform object scale cannot hide stretched quads or large error.
- Added a 60-degree local quad-warpage ceiling and per-component Euler checks.
- Added target-scale preprocessing to direct PairClosure and mode-specific
  field/pairing weights; unsafe concave triangle pairs now remain unpaired.
- Added ParityPath sparse quad transitions and deterministic target-aware
  selection against the conservative global corner closure.
- Added a topology-gated edge-rotation/QEM unlock for irreducible low-budget
  scan proxies; every round is transactional and signature preserving.
- Fixed the old collinear per-triangle pure-quad workaround.
- Fixed duplicate candidate recomputation in TRIAD-Q.
- Fixed boundary edges being reported as non-manifold.
- Fixed orphaned mesh data in Replace mode.
- Preserved material-slot order and isolated baked target materials.
- Made baking transactional: all settings and datablocks roll back on failure.
- Added real isolated install/enable smoke tests for both release zip layouts.
- Added algorithm and photogrammetry workflow documentation, unit coverage, and
  release packaging.

## 0.3.0

- Added TRIAD-Q Lite, standalone OBJ I/O, seed-swept pairing, and Blender smoke
  coverage.
